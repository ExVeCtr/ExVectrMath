# ExVectrMath
Part of the ExVeCtr project. 
ExVectrMath implements high level mathematics like Matricies, vectors, quaternions etc.
Can be used standalone without any other ExVeCtr libraries. 
## **This project is under initial development. Things will probably break.**
## Current goal roadmap:
- [X] Port from previous projects.
- [ ] Implement more stuff like FFT etc.
- [ ] Documentation.
